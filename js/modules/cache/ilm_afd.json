Dry weather is expected today and Thursday as a ridge of high pressure covers the Carolinas. Showers and thunderstorms will return Friday ahead of a cold front that will move offshore Friday night. Cooler weather builds in for the weekend, but a significant warm up will begin Monday as southwest winds return.<\/p>\n<p>.UPDATE... Forecast on track for sunny day with cool gusty northeasterly winds and high temps reaching the mid 60s to near 70.<\/p>\n<p>.NEAR TERM \/THROUGH TONIGHT\/... The coolest day of the week on tap today as high pressure passes by to our north keeping a northerly component to the boundary layer winds. Highs in the mid 60s are approaching 10 degrees below normal. Clear skies today will be brought by not only low amplitude mid level flow but also healthy NVA from a mid level trough moving offshore and the minor height rises that follow. Tonight the center of the high will be off the New England but there is still a well defined ridge axis back into the Carolinas. This will keep a light onshore flow locally that will allow temperatures to cool down to their seasonable norms.<\/p>\n<p>.SHORT TERM \/THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT\/... High pressure retreating farther off the East Coast on Thursday should lead to easterly winds bringing shallow Atlantic moisture onshore. Despite the erosion of the ridge, enough of the subsidence inversion should remain intact to cap off the cumulus at shallow depth near the coast. Inland where warmer low level temperatures and cooler mid level temperatures will exist there is some potential for deeper cumulus and some pop-up convective showers. I`m keeping 20 PoPs only across Hartsville and Bennettsville for now. Thursday`s highs should reach the lower 70s away from the coast.<\/p>\n<p>Shortwave energy diving from the northern Plains states Thursday to the southern Appalachians on Friday will lead to a diffluent upper flow over the Carolinas. The left exit region of jet streak over southern GA\/northern FL will pass over the coastal Carolinas during the day. Although low level moisture return is meager, dynamics look plenty strong enough to lead to considerable coverage of showers and thunderstorms, possibly beginning inland before daybreak on Friday. Coverage may be highest before afternoon as a mid level dry slot is shown on the GFS to rotate overhead by 18z, perhaps leading to lesser coverage later in the day.<\/p>\n<p>Severe weather is possible on Friday. Steep mid level lapse rates (exceeding 7 deg C per km on both the GFS and NAM) are often correlated with large hail. Effective bulk shear of 35-40 knots could lead to organized convective cells given CAPE of 500 J\/kg inland and over 1000 J\/kg near the coast. From a climatological perspective April is in second place behind May for the highest number of golf ball and larger hail reports across our forecast area. Forecast PoPs are 60-70 percent with aerial average QPF of 0.25 to 0.50 inches.<\/p>\n<p>Surface low pressure will move eastward across Virginia and offshore Friday night, dragging a surface cold front through the eastern Carolinas. Clearing and drying should occur after the front with PoPs diminishing after sunset.<\/p>\n<p>.LONG TERM \/SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY\/... A second lobe of vorticity will rotate through the East Coast upper trough on Saturday, deepening the trough to its greatest extent during the afternoon when the GFS, Canadian, and ECMWF all show 500 mb temps falling to -22C to -26C. Although 00z GFS forecast soundings show only a sliver of instability atop the deep mixed layer on Saturday, its dewpoints are considerably lower than the majority of NBM ensemble component members. There`s enough potential for isolated showers to develop within the cold air aloft I`m including a 20 PoP Saturday afternoon and evening.<\/p>\n<p>Dry weather is forecast for the remainder of the weekend into next week. High pressure should move across the area late Sunday followed by an impressive warmup Monday into Tuesday. High temps on Tuesday have a reasonably good chance of making it into the mid 80s almost everywhere away from the coast. There`s a 30-40 percent chance of reaching the upper 80s according to NBM ensemble data.<\/p>\n<p>.AVIATION \/12Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY\/... VFR with clear skies through the period while winds remain generally from the NE, possibly veering to E at times late this afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>Extended Outlook...VFR through Thursday. Restrictions should return early Friday due to an approaching frontal system.<\/p>\n<p>.MARINE... Through tonight...Higher pressures being dragged into the Carolinas today and tonight by low pressure developing east of Florida. This tightens the gradient today such that a super-borderline set of advisory conditions sets up. This will be in the form of 25kt wind gusts that are likely not very frequent, but also some 6 ft seas that will only advect westward into part of our 20nm zones, and not even all of them at that. Gtown County waters will have the least coverage of advisory-worthy 6 ft waves, notably less than half of the zone area, and so no headlines planned there.  A similar argument can be made for AMZ 252, where the 6 footers will only be along Frying Pan Shoals. In between lies AMZ 254\/Horry County waters with it`s locally maxed concavity preventing much intrusion at all of 6 ft waves. At this time we`ve limited SCA to AMZ250 and just for a portion of the late morning and afternoon hours. The ridge axis is maintained into the area tonight from the center of the high off of New England keeping winds onshore but also lighter as the Florida low drifts further east.<\/p>\n<p>Thursday through Sunday...Retreating high pressure offshore and low pressure advancing eastward across the Midwest will bring veering but light onshore winds across the Carolinas on Thursday. As the low deepens west of the Appalachians Thursday night wind speeds should increase to 10-15 kt, then will veer to southwest at a solid 15 knots on Friday as the low moves eastward across Virginia. Showers and thunderstorms are also expected on Friday, some with significantly higher wind gusts possible. A cold front trailing behind the low is expected to move off the Carolina coast Friday evening, followed by offshore winds the remainder of Friday night through the weekend as high pressure builds in from the west.<\/p>\n<p>.ILM WATCHES\/WARNINGS\/ADVISORIES...
