The high pressure will ridge SW from offshore across the region into tonight ensuring dry weather will continue. Highs today are expected to range from the mid to upper 50s NE into the lower to mid 60s south with mainly sunny skies. Mostly clear skies are expected tonight with the exception of increasing cloudiness later tonight in the north and west. This is due to the next system developing to our NW and the continued return of WAA. Low with lows 38-45 north to south.<\/p>\n<p>.SHORT TERM \/THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT\/... As of 252 AM Wednesday...<\/p>\n<p>Showers\/isolated thunderstorms quickly return Thursday from the west.<\/p>\n<p>Some significant rain of 0.50 to 1.00 inch expected in northern NC through daybreak Friday.<\/p>\n<p>A mid\/upper level trough will dive SE through into the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians from the Midwest. Surface low pressure is expected to develop in the vicinity of the southern Appalachians by 12z\/Friday. Significant H5 height falls and increasing UVV will allow showers to develop and become widespread from the TN\/OH valley into western NC Thursday morning, spreading east into central NC during the day. Showers are likely, especially in the western and central portions of the area Thursday night as the low pressure develops just to our west by daybreak Friday. Severe storm threats appear low as the instability will likely be nearly NIL. However, storms that develop over the lower TN Valley region in the more unstable air and near the nose of the upper jet may track quickly SE into portions of the mountains. Some of these storms may hold together, but lose their severe characteristics as they approach our region.<\/p>\n<p>QPF on the order of 0.50 to locally 1 inch will be possible in the Triad. Amounts are forecast to be lesser to the east, with generally 0.25 to locally 0.50. Highs should reach the 70 degree mark east and south before the shower chances increase Thursday. Temperatures will be cooler with the earlier onset of cloudiness and showers in the west and north, where mostly lower to mid 60s are expected (may hold in the 50s far NW if the rain begins early enough). Lows Thursday night should be mostly in the lower to mid 50s.<\/p>\n<p>.LONG TERM \/FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY\/... As of 258 AM Wednesday...<\/p>\n<p>Friday through Saturday: A high amplitude trough will slowly lift across central NC Friday through Saturday. Increasing mid-level height falls will meet strong sswly mid-level flow and anomalous moisture promoting wet conditions Friday into Saturday. However, boundary-layer moisture and associated low-level lapse rates will be limited both days, and as such severe weather isn`t expected at this time. However, given the strong flow aloft, can`t fully rule out a stronger storm or two especially Friday afternoon\/evening. Median ensemble output generally suggests anywhere from a half inch to an inch may be possible over this time period.<\/p>\n<p>As we pivot to Saturday, the upper system will slowly migrate offshore.  Models indicate that enough upper forcing and anomalous moisture may hang around to promote showers at times through Saturday evening (highest POPs in the east).  Rain chances will end near sunrise Sunday morning as the system pulls further offshore.<\/p>\n<p>Highs Friday will range from the lower to mid 60s north to lower 70s south.  Cooler conditions are expected Saturday with area-wide lower to mid 60s expected.<\/p>\n<p>Sunday through Tuesday: Dry nwly flow aloft on Sunday, followed by zonal mid-level ridging on Monday will promote dry conditions both days. After a cooler day in the upper 60s Sunday, temperatures will rebound back into the mid to upper 70s Monday under ridging aloft. Flow turns more sswly ahead of our next trough on Tuesday, allowing temperatures to ride back into the lower to mid 80s.  A front will approach and pass through our area Tuesday into Wednesday.
