Canadian high pressure lingers across the area through this morning, before sliding offshore late today and tonight. Remaining cooler than average today, despite plenty of sunshine. More seasonal temperatures are expected late in the week, though an approaching system from the west will bring another chance for showers for Thursday night into Saturday morning.<\/p>\n<p>.NEAR TERM \/THROUGH TONIGHT\/... As of 955 AM EDT Wednesday...<\/p>\n<p>Key Messages:<\/p>\n<p>- Continued cool and dry conditions today with increasing   clouds inland late this evening into Thursday morning.<\/p>\n<p>- Patchy frost is possible tonight across portions of south   central Virginia and the Maryland Eastern Shore.<\/p>\n<p>Latest analysis reveals chilly 1027mb sfc high pressure centered over the mid-Atlantic. Aloft, a dampening upper trough is in place over the region. Freeze Warnings have been allowed to expire as temps have warmed above freezing with temps as of 955 AM in the 40s across the FA. Surface high slides offshore during the afternoon, as the northern stream trough slides off the New England coast. Resultant quasi-zonal flow aloft will promote further drying and mainly sunny and pleasant conditions, albeit a bit cool by mid-April standards. High temperatures range from the upper 40s\/lower 50s at the coast, to the mid- upper 50s well inland. A light E wind is expected along the coast as the high shifts offshore, and light out of the S to SE inland.<\/p>\n<p>High pressure remains immediately offshore tonight, with winds veering around to the E-SE. Temperatures remain chilly and below average, but no quite as cold with lows in the upper 30s to lower 40s. We`ll start the evening mainly clear, with increasing clouds overnight into Wednesday morning. Increasing cloud cover lowers confidence, however, at least patchy frost is possible across portions of south central VA and the MD Eastern Shore where lows of 34-36F are possible.<\/p>\n<p>.SHORT TERM \/THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY\/... As of 345 AM EDT Wednesday...<\/p>\n<p>Key Messages:<\/p>\n<p>-  Increasing clouds Thursday, with showers developing later    Thursday afternoon and evening.<\/p>\n<p>A potent shortwave trough dives into the Central Plains Thursday with surface high pressure pushing farther offshore. Locally, the mid-level flow becomes W-SW with a clipper system preceding the primary trough. This weak disturbance aloft pushes through Thursday afternoon and night, will bring a 20-40% chc of showers to the Piedmont by afternoon, reaching the coast by evening before (briefly) tapering off overnight. Forecast high temperatures range from the upper 50s\/around 60F over the Delmarva and northern neck, low to mid 60s central and upper 60s\/near 70F SE. Lows Thursday night in the upper 40s to low 50s for most, mid to upper 50s SE in breezy onshore (SE) flow.<\/p>\n<p>Previously referenced deep upper trough digs SE across the mid- south into the southeast late Thu night through Saturday. Temporal issues remain amongst deterministic models. However, the 09\/00z EPS\/GEFS still depict the highest PW anomalies from 06z-18z Friday. Therefore, the highest PoPs (high-end likely to categorical) for showers in the latest forecast are from Thursday night (well inland) through Friday, as the upper trough briefly closes off and lingers over the mid-Atlantic into Friday night. While clouds and showers should limit destabilization to a good degree, there is a slight chc of embedded thunder that will need to be monitored for Friday, especially from south- central VA into NE NC given developing deep-layer shear and steepening mid-level lapse rates as the low pressure and its attendant cold front sweep across the Carolinas Friday afternoon and night. SPC has outlooked SE VA and NE NC for now, which makes sense, as forcing should be maximized across the SErn third of the area coincident with peak heating. Any severe threat should be short-lived, with the warm sector quickly getting scoured out by the trailing cold pool into Friday evening.<\/p>\n<p>Temperatures should generally be in the 60s ahead of the front Friday, with Saturday looking a bit cooler in the 50s to lower 60s as clouds and moisture linger<\/p>\n<p>The upper trough lingers along the coastal mid-Atlantic on Saturday. Models continue to indicate low-level moisture and clouds hang around through the day, which portends continued cloud cover and scattered (mainly diurnally-driven) showers Saturday afternoon. Highs mainly in the 50s to low 60s SE coast.<\/p>\n<p>.LONG TERM \/SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY\/... As of 345 AM EDT Wednesday...<\/p>\n<p>Key Messages:<\/p>\n<p>- Rain arrives Thursday night into Saturday as another front   moves through the forecast area.<\/p>\n<p>- Temperatures will be seasonable later this weekend into early   next week, with a warming trend developing for the middle of   next week.<\/p>\n<p>The upper trough finally scoots offshore Sunday into early next week, with quasi-zonal mid- level flow allowing for a gradual warmup early next week. After a cooler day in the upper 60s Sunday, temperatures will rebound back into the mid to upper 70s Monday under low-amplitude ridging aloft. Another northern stream trough dives across the upper midwest into the Great Lakes, with warming SSW flow bringing a sharp warm-up on Tuesday. Given the timing of the slow and moisture-starved system, Wednesday could easily be a warmer-than-normal day as well. For that reason, will keep PoPs on the low side and stay on the high end of the guidance envelope for temps through the middle of next week.<\/p>\n<p>.AVIATION \/14Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY\/... As of 630 AM EDT Wednesday...<\/p>\n<p>VFR across area terminals will persist through this evening under a mainly clear sky with high pressure over the area. Winds remain light and variable inland, and NNE 10 kt along the coast. Winds become S-SE 7-12 kt for most of the area this afternoon, again highest at the coast. At SBY, the wind direction likely turns to the SW in the afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>Outlook: VFR conditions will prevail through Thursday. Flight restrictions are likely to develop later Thursday night into Friday, as showers spread across the area ahead of developing low pressure and its associated cold front, which crosses the area Friday afternoon into Friday evening. S winds also become gusty Thu aftn into Friday across the terminals, with gusts to 20-25 kt lingering along the coast into Friday morning. VFR conditions return Saturday afternoon into early next week.<\/p>\n<p>.MARINE... As of 345 AM EST Wednesday...<\/p>\n<p>Key Messages:<\/p>\n<p>- SCAs remain in effect for the Chesapeake Bay and northern   coastal waters north of Parramore Island.<\/p>\n<p>- A period of elevated SE winds is possible Thursday into   Friday ahead of the next cold front with marginal SCA   conditions possible.<\/p>\n<p>- SCAs are possible this weekend behind a cold front.<\/p>\n<p>High pressure across the east-central U.S. has built in behind yesterday`s cold front. An ongoing CAA surge has resulted in elevated winds in the Bay and in the MD coastal waters. The high will continue to slide eastward today, ejecting offshore by this evening. This will allow winds to diminish rapidly to near 10 kts by this afternoon. Sub-SCA conditions are expected briefly today through Thursday morning. The gradient between the aforementioned high and an area of low pressure that will be moving over the Ohio River Valley region by Thursday will cause winds to increase Thursday into Friday. This surge appears marginal, however, at least a brief period of low-end SCA conditions appears possible Thu across the Chesapeake Bay and possibly the rivers. Another area of low pressure is progged to move across the coastal waters Friday afternoon through Saturday morning. As this low transits across the area, guidance has trended up in terms of wind speeds so have nudged winds up some on during this timeframe. Winds of 15 to 20 kts are possible in the Bay and near 20 kt sustained winds may be realized in the northern Ocean zones. The low will drag an attendant cold front through overnight Friday, resulting in a subsequent CAA surge on Saturday night through Sunday. High pressure will build in by the end of the weekend, dropping winds to around 10 to 15 kt or less Monday and Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>Waves of 2-3 ft across the Bay this morning will gradually subside to 1-2 ft, and seas of 3-5 ft across the Ocean will subside to 2-4 ft by this afternoon. The wind surge on Thursday will bring waves back to 2-3 ft. Seas will return to 3 to 5 ft by the end of the week as the low moves across the area, remaining elevated through Sunday, before subsiding below SCA criteria by the start of next week.<\/p>\n<p>.HYDROLOGY... A River Flood Warning remains in effect for the Meherrin River at Lawrenceville. We continue to monitor the Nottoway River at Stony Creek and Sebrell, which are forecast to approach flood stage tonight\/early Thursday (Stony Creek) and later Friday into Saturday (Sebrell). See water.noaa.gov for more site- specific information. The gauge at Lawrenceville crested just after 3am this morning and the water level is presently falling. That warning may therefore be dropped later this morning.<\/p>\n<p>.AKQ WATCHES\/WARNINGS\/ADVISORIES... MD...None. NC...None. VA...None.
